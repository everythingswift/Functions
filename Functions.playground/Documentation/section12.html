		<h1>Constant and Variable parameters:</h1>
		<p>
		Till now all the functions we&#39;ve seen have always had constant parameters. 
		If you would try to change their values, there&#39;ll be a compile time error. 
		Swift provides you the capability to create a variable parameter name as well. 
		This can be used to modify or update it&#39;s value within the function. 
		The value can only be changed within the scope of the function.
