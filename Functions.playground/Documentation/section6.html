    Functions with optional return types
	</h1>
	<p>
	The above method getEvenAndOdd does not perform any checks for exceptions. 
	For example, the firstTenNumbers that was passed could have been a zero element array. 
	In that case the evenNumbers and oddNumbers array returned are empty. 
	In this case we can use optional return types and use optional binding to verify before we access a nil value.
